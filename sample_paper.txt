The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Software Development

Abstract
This paper explores the transformational role of AI in coding.

Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the software development lifecycle. According to primary research by Smith and Jones (2024), developer productivity increased by 40% when using LLMs. "Copilots have become essential," states the annual report by TechGiant Corp (2023).

However, reliance on AI poses risks. A study by TheRealInstitute (2022) suggests potential security vulnerabilities. 
Controversially, bogus claims such as "AI can predict the future of stock markets with 100% accuracy" (FakeAuthor, 2025) distract from real progress.
